# Excel Download Functionality

## Overview

The TikTok Downloader now includes an enhanced Excel download feature that processes each video individually, ensuring that all videos are properly downloaded and their metadata is captured in the Excel file.

## Problem Solved

**Previous Issue**: When downloading from an Excel file with multiple video URLs, only the first video was being downloaded, and metadata was not properly captured for subsequent videos.

**Solution**: Implemented a new `download_videos_from_excel` method that processes each video individually in a sequential loop.

## How It Works

The new Excel download process follows this sequence for each video:

1. **Download First**: Downloads the video file to the local storage
2. **Fetch Information**: Extracts metadata and information about the downloaded video
3. **Add to Excel**: Immediately adds the metadata to the Excel file
4. **Save Excel**: Saves the Excel file after each video to ensure data persistence
5. **Next Video**: Moves to the next video in the list

## Key Features

### Individual Video Processing
- Each video is processed completely before moving to the next
- If one video fails, the process continues with the remaining videos
- Metadata is captured and saved for each successfully downloaded video

### Real-time Progress Updates
- Progress callback system shows current video being processed
- Status updates for each step: download, metadata extraction, Excel processing
- Real-time updates in the GUI Excel integration component

### Data Persistence
- Excel file is saved after each video to prevent data loss
- Final save ensures all data is properly persisted
- Each video's metadata is immediately available in the Excel file

## Implementation Details

### New Method: `download_videos_from_excel`

```python
def download_videos_from_excel(self, urls: List[str], export_to_excel: bool = True, progress_callback=None) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Download videos from Excel file with individual processing and metadata handling.
    
    This method processes each video individually:
    1. Downloads the video first
    2. Fetches its information/metadata
    3. Adds metadata to Excel file
    4. Moves to the next video
    
    Args:
        urls: List of video URLs to download
        export_to_excel: Whether to export metadata to Excel
        progress_callback: Optional callback for progress updates
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary with download results and statistics
    """
```

### Progress Callback System

The method accepts an optional progress callback function that receives:
- `current`: Current video number being processed
- `total`: Total number of videos to process
- `video_title`: Title or status of the current video

```python
def progress_callback(current: int, total: int, video_title: str):
    print(f"Processing video {current}/{total}: {video_title}")
```

### GUI Integration

The main GUI automatically detects Excel downloads and uses the new method:
- Excel downloads use `download_videos_from_excel`
- Other downloads use the standard `download_multiple_videos`
- Progress updates are displayed in the Excel integration component

## Usage

### In the GUI

1. Load an Excel file with TikTok URLs
2. Select the URL column
3. Click "Download from Excel"
4. Confirm the download operation
5. Monitor progress in real-time
6. Excel file is automatically updated after each video

### Programmatically

```python
from core.download_manager import DownloadManager

# Initialize download manager
manager = DownloadManager(output_dir="downloads", platform="tiktok")

# Define progress callback
def progress_callback(current, total, video_title):
    print(f"Video {current}/{total}: {video_title}")

# Download videos from Excel
results = manager.download_videos_from_excel(
    urls=video_urls,
    export_to_excel=True,
    progress_callback=progress_callback
)

# Check results
print(f"Successfully downloaded: {results['successful']}/{results['valid_urls']}")
print(f"Excel file: {results['excel_file']}")
```

## Benefits

1. **Reliability**: Each video is processed individually, preventing batch failures
2. **Data Integrity**: Metadata is captured and saved immediately for each video
3. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time updates show exactly what's happening
4. **Fault Tolerance**: Individual video failures don't stop the entire process
5. **Immediate Results**: Excel file is updated after each video, not just at the end

## Error Handling

The method includes comprehensive error handling:
- Individual video failures are logged and tracked
- Excel operations are wrapped in try-catch blocks
- Progress callbacks are protected from exceptions
- Detailed error information is included in results

## Testing

Use the provided test scripts to verify functionality:

### Basic Excel Download Test
```bash
python test_excel_download.py
```

### Custom Naming Test
```bash
python test_custom_naming.py
```

These scripts will test the new methods with sample URLs and show the complete workflow.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Only First Video Downloads with Custom Names

**Symptoms**: When using custom names, only the first video downloads and others fail.

**Cause**: This was caused by improper video counter management when extracting video information.

**Solution**: The system now properly separates video info extraction from actual downloading, ensuring each video gets a unique filename.

### Issue: Excel Method Not Being Used

**Symptoms**: Downloads still use the old method even when Excel export is enabled.

**Cause**: The system wasn't properly detecting when to use the Excel-optimized method.

**Solution**: The system now automatically uses the Excel method when:
- Source is explicitly "Excel"
- Export to Excel setting is enabled
- Custom names are used (since they require Excel metadata)

### Debug Information

The system now provides detailed logging for troubleshooting:
- Video counter values before and after each download
- Download path generation details
- Method selection logic
- Progress tracking for each step

## Migration

Existing code using `download_multiple_videos` will continue to work unchanged. The new method is specifically for Excel-based downloads and provides enhanced functionality for that use case.

## Custom Naming Support

The Excel download functionality now properly supports custom naming for downloaded videos. When you specify a custom base name in the download settings:

- Videos are numbered sequentially: `customname__1.mp4`, `customname__2.mp4`, etc.
- The video counter is properly managed to avoid conflicts
- Each video gets a unique filename even with custom naming
- Excel metadata includes the correct download paths for custom-named files

### How Custom Naming Works

1. **Counter Management**: The video counter is reset at the start of each batch
2. **Sequential Naming**: Each video gets the next available number
3. **Path Generation**: Download paths are correctly generated for Excel metadata
4. **Conflict Avoidance**: Existing files are checked to find the next available number

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- Parallel processing with configurable concurrency limits
- Resume capability for interrupted downloads
- Enhanced progress reporting with time estimates
- Integration with external progress tracking systems
